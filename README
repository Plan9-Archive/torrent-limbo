# status

in development.  don't expect things to work yet.


# intro

this package contains a bittorrent client and tools for verifying
torrents, printing info from .torrent files.  in the future, tools
for creating .torrent files and being a tracker.


# install

this package depends on "http".

to install, bind/symlink/include a mkconfig (e.g. from your inferno
install), and:

	mk install

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.


# latest

the latest version can be found at

    http://www.ueber.net/code/r/torrent



# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo

- torrent/get: seems verifying (or .state-file reading) doesn't work properly, we refetch the file.
- put more in progress/peerevents, such as errors (eg from tracker, when writing to disk).
- explain the design better
- some tk ui to show activity & progress
- perhaps put the code for each thread in a separate file.  should help to reduce accidental global variable use & associated obscure bugs.
- implement tracker
- torrent/get: allow starting after being stopped.  implement start ctl.
- torrent/get: move styx code to separate file?
- collapse some code from appl/lib/bittorrent/*?
- use multiple peers
- implement rarest first and random
- keep track of which peer has which piece
- handle choke/unchoke correctly, send interested only when peer has data
- think of file system interface, for torrent/get
- write manual page
