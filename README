# todo

- collapse some code from appl/lib/bittorrent/*?
- use multiple peers
- implement rarest first and random
- keep track of which peer has which piece
- handle choke/unchoke correctly, send interested only when peer has data
- think of file system interface, for torrent/get
- write manual page
